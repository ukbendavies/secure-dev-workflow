# Enhance Windows Terminal

This document describes how to enable unicode font support for an enhanced shell prompt for use with oh-my-posh and use Windows acrylic for transparency.

Note: [settings.json](settings.json) in the 'terminal' directory is included as an _example only_ for completeness and should not be used verbatim as _Terminal_ changes its specification frequently.

## Terminal configuration documentation

An article describing `Terminal` updated to use `powerline` theme with frosted glass and font updates

## Fonts with unicode support

A good font for use with `oh-my-posh` is `Cascadia-Code-PL` that can be downloaded from:
[Cascadia-code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases)

This can be unzipped and installed into Windows Fonts. To do this search for 'Font settings' in the Windows start menu and use the _drag drop to install_ feature with the font file you'd like to install.
