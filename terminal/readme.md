# Enhance Windows Terminal

This document describes how to enable unicode font support for an enhanced shell prompt for use with oh-my-posh and use Windows acrylic for transparency.

Note: ```settings.json``` is included as an example for completeness and should not be used verbatim as _Terminal_ changes its specification frequently.

## Terminal configuration documentation

Terminal updated to use `powerline` theme with frosted glass and font updates
