# Enhance Windows Terminal

This document describes how to enable unicode font support for an enhanced shell prompt for use with oh-my-posh and use Windows acrylic for transparency.

The ```settings.json``` is included as a terminal configuration example but should not be used verbatim as terminal changes its spec frequently.

## Terminal configuration documentation

Terminal updated to use `powerline` theme with frosted glass and font updates
