# Enhance Windows Terminal

This document describes how to enable unicode font support for an enhanced shell prompt for use with oh-my-posh and use Windows acrylic for transparency.

Note: `settings.json` is included as an example for completeness and should not be used verbatim as _Terminal_ changes its specification frequently.

## Terminal configuration documentation

An article describing `Terminal` updated to use `powerline` theme with frosted glass and font updates

## Fonts with unicode support

A good font for use with `oh-my-posh` is `Cascadia-Code-PL` that can be downloaded from: 
[Cascadia-code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases)

This can be unziped and installed into Windows Fonts. To do this search for 'Font settings' in the Windows start menu and use the drag drop to install feature with the font file you'd like to install.
